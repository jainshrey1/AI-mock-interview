            ".NET Core handles memory management through a process called garbage collection. This automated system manages the allocation and release of memory for your application, preventing memory leaks and ensuring that unused objects are removed from memory. Garbage collection in .NET Core is efficient and works in the background, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying excessively about memory management.\n",

            "MODEL GENERATION - ZERO SHOT:\n",
            ".NET Core handles memory management by using a garbage collector to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer in use. The garbage collector periodically scans the memory and identifies objects that are no longer referenced by the program. These objects are then marked as garbage and are automatically removed from memory. This allows the program to use memory more efficiently and reduces the risk of memory leaks.\n",

Reducing the size of the intermediate dataset can significantly lower the network overhead.\\n\\n### End\",\n",

It sets defaults for everything, allowing developers to get started quickly without having to specify every little detail. In Rails, this principle is applied through naming conventions, file structure, and default behaviors. For example, if you have a model named 'User', Rails will automatically look for a database table named 'users'. It also provides default routes based on controller names and actions.\\n\\n### End\",\n",
